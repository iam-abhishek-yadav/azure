**Virtual Network:** A Virtual Network (VNet) in Azure is a logically isolated network that securely connects Azure resources and extends on-premises networks. Key features include:
- **Isolation**: VNets provide isolation at the network level for segmenting resources and controlling traffic.
- **Subnetting**: Divide a VNet into subnets for resource organization and traffic control.
- **Address Space**: VNets have an address space defined using CIDR notation, determining the IP address range.

**Subnets, CIDR**

- **Subnets:** Subnets are subdivisions of a Virtual Network, allowing for better organization and traffic management.

- **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):** CIDR notation represents IP addresses and their routing prefix, specifying the range of IP addresses for a network.

**Routes and Route Tables**

- **Routes:** Routes dictate how network traffic is directed, specifying the destination and next hop.

- **Route Tables:** Route Tables are collections of routes associated with subnets, enabling custom routing rules.

**Network Security Groups (NSGs):** NSGs are fundamental for Azure's network security, allowing filtering of inbound and outbound traffic. Key aspects include:
- **Rules**: NSGs define allowed or denied traffic based on source, destination, port, and protocol.
- **Default Rules**: NSGs have default rules for controlling traffic within the Virtual Network and between subnets.
- **Association**: NSGs can be associated with subnets or individual network interfaces.

**Application Security Groups (ASGs):** ASGs group Azure virtual machines based on application requirements, simplifying network security:
- **Simplification**: ASGs allow defining rules based on application roles instead of individual IP addresses.
- **Dynamic Membership**: ASGs support dynamic membership based on tags or other attributes.
- **Rule Association**: Security rules can be associated with ASGs for intuitive and scalable network security management.

**Azure Application Gateway & WAF:** Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage and route traffic to your web applications. Web Application Firewall (WAF) provides protection against web vulnerabilities. Key features include:
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.
- **SSL Termination**: Offloads SSL processing, improving the efficiency of web servers.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Protects web applications from common web vulnerabilities and exploits.

**Azure Load Balancer:** Azure Load Balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed. Key features include:
- **Load Balancing Algorithms**: Supports different algorithms for distributing traffic, such as round-robin and least connections.
- **Availability Sets**: Works seamlessly with availability sets to ensure high availability.
- **Inbound and Outbound Traffic**: Balances both inbound and outbound traffic.

**Azure DNS:** Azure DNS is a scalable and secure domain hosting service. It provides name resolution using the Microsoft Azure infrastructure. Key features include:
- **Domain Hosting**: Hosts domain names and provides name resolution within Azure.
- **Integration with Azure Services**: Easily integrates with other Azure services like App Service and Traffic Manager.
- **Global Availability**: Provides low-latency responses globally.

**Azure Firewall:** Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources. Key features include:
- **Stateful Firewall**: Allows or denies traffic based on rules and supports stateful inspection.
- **Application FQDN Filtering**: Filters traffic based on fully qualified domain names.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Integrates with threat intelligence feeds for enhanced security.

**Virtual Network Peering and VNet Gateway**

- **Virtual Network Peering:** Virtual Network Peering allows connecting Azure Virtual Networks directly, enabling resources in one VNet to communicate with resources in another. Key features include:
	- **Global VNet Peering**: Peering can be established across regions.
	- **Transitive Routing**: Traffic between peered VNets flows directly, improving performance.

- **VNet Gateway:** VNet Gateway enables secure communication between on-premises networks and Azure Virtual Networks. Key features include:
	- **Site-to-Site VPN**: Connects on-premises networks to Azure over an encrypted VPN tunnel.
	- **Point-to-Site VPN**: Enables secure remote access to Azure resources.

**VPN Gateway:** Azure VPN Gateway provides secure, site-to-site connectivity between your on-premises network and Azure. Key features include:
- **IPsec/IKE VPN Protocols**: Ensures secure communication over the Internet.
- **High Availability**: Supports active-active and active-passive configurations for high availability.
- **BGP Support**: Allows dynamic routing between your on-premises network and Azure.
